    <p>Velocity Laboratories started as a collaboration between Robert Caudle 
      and John Neubert to help clients bring pain-relieving medicines to market 
      sooner through innovative and accelerated operant pain-testing services. 
      Robert and John were joined by Niall P. Murphy, a scientist with extensive
      expertise in preclinical reward and addiction assays. We work closely with
      others with global industry and imaging experience. Together, Velocity 
      Laboratories brings you a premier preclinical assay of pain.</p>
